# 🚀 Overview

The fitness training application is a Python-based project designed to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. A fitness app has been developed that allows users to create and manage workout routines, track progress and monitor their personal fitness journey.

# 🛠️ Solution

Basic OOP concepts are used: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Organize Python code into multiple modules and maintain clear, reusable class structures.

# 📝 System operation

 - File User: 👤 The User class allows the user to create and configure a user profile. The user has the option to enter their personal information (name, age, weight, height, fitness goal) to create a new profile in the application. It can also make its own updates as it sets, changing its weight and fitness goal over time.

 - Exercise File: 🔩 The Exercise class creates the library of exercises that can be performed by the user and is saved in the fitness application's database.
Each exercise has a name, description and difficulty level.

 - Workout File: 🥇 The Workout class creates user workout plans with built-in routines from the exercises in the library. Each workout has a name, sets, reps, and a specified rest time between sets. In addition to creating a training program, the user can also view and modify an already created one. I can add exercises to my training plans with corresponding sets, reps and rest times. It can also eliminate exercise.

 - Track Progress File: 🏆 In the Track Progress class, the user logs their completed workouts. It has the ability to track your progress over time and generate reports showing training history and statistics about them.

 - File Main: In this file, a system is created with a basic text interface for the user, which allows him to manage the FitnessApp application through certain options, in the form of a menu. All the individual classes and structs used in the application above are visualized to the user as different options. He has the option to choose how he will manage the application:

Please pick one of the following options:
 1. Create a new user profile.
 2. Update existing profile
 3. See available exercises
 4. Create or Modify Workout Plans
 5. View Workout Plans
 6. Log a Completed Workout
 7. View Personal Workout History
 8. Exit

As a result, the program executes and visualizes the choice submitted by the user.
