# 🚀 Overview
The fitness training application is a Python-based project designed to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. A fitness app has been developed that allows users to create and manage workout routines, track progress and monitor their personal fitness journey.

# 🛠️ Solution
Basic OOP concepts are used: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Organize Python code into multiple modules and maintain clear, reusable class structures.
